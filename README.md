# Smart-Aquarium
This project utilizes an Arduino Uno to create a Smart-Aquarium that automates fish feeding, monitors water cleanliness, and checks the aquarium's temperature. Designed for indoor use, this system ensures a healthy environment for your aquatic pets with minimal manual intervention.

# Features
- Automated Fish Feeding: Ensures your fish are fed at regular intervals, preventing overfeeding or underfeeding.
- Water Cleanliness Monitoring: Keeps track of the water quality to ensure a healthy environment for the fish.
- Temperature Checking: Continuously monitors the water temperature to maintain optimal conditions.
# Technologies Used
- Arduino Uno: The brain of the operation, controlling all sensors and actuators.
- Relay: Used to control high-power devices like the heater.
- LCD 12C: Displays real-time information about the aquarium's status.
# How It Works
- Temperature Monitoring: The system uses a temperature sensor to measure the water temperature. If the temperature falls below or exceeds a certain threshold, the system activates or deactivates the heater through the relay.
- Automated Feeding: A servo motor is used to dispense food at scheduled intervals. This ensures that your fish are fed regularly even when you are not at home.
- water Quality Monitoring: Sensors are used to monitor the cleanliness of the water. If the water quality deteriorates, the system can alert you to perform maintenance.
